| Standard Elements of Game Design | Pacman Game Design Elements                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Playing Character (PC)           | (1) Packman                                                  |
| Non-playing Characters(NPC)      | (4) Ghosts                                                   |
| Goal of Player                   | Collect dots without dying                                   |
| Rule of the Game                 | 2 lives for PC, Packman can eat dots, 4 Ghosts patrolling, Ghosts can eat Pacman when touching, 5 power pellets in total, If packman eats a power pellet he can eat the ghosts for limited time (ghosts turns pale in color), Ghosts can be reborn after eaten if they return to spawn, when all the dots have been eaten the game is won, game is lost when packman loses both lives. |
| Balance of Rules                 | There are 4 monsters patrolling, but because there are power pellets he has the ability to win easier. The corners are a place where the packman can go and hide. |
| Adaptivity                       | The amount of ghosts and dots increase as the game progresses, and other games the dots are more widely spread and less power pellets making it harder to get to them with the ghosts. |
| Skill vs. Chance                 | The movement of ghosts are random whether the packman gets detected has an element of chance. The players skill to maneuver packman around the ghosts and eat the dots relies on the players skill. |
| Feedback                         | Player gets points depending on the dots or the ghosts they eat; player loses life when eaten by the ghosts; sound gives feedback that the game is ending or starting. |
| Game Story                       | The packman needs to eat the dots because the ghosts need them to survive, but the ghosts have invaded his land so he does this out of revenge. |
